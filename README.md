> Drucker taught that what gets measured gets managed. So, how can we possibly hope to manage our time if we don’t measure precisely where our time goes? Inspired by Drucker’s challenge, I’ve kept a spreadsheet with one key metric: the number of creative hours logged each day, with the self-imposed imperative to stay above a thousand creative hours a year. This mechanism keeps me on the creative march—doing research, developing concepts, and writing—despite ever-increasing demands for travel, team leadership, and working with executives.

tlog.py - a simple script designed to allow oneself to log and analyse their time.

### Usage
```
git clone https://github.com/Nquxii/timelog && cd timelog
```
```
python3 tlog.py -h
```
